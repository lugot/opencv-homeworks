This repository contains the lab experiences and a project made in the
Computer Vision course (University of Padua, a.a. 19/20, second semester)
implemented in OpenCV. 

This includes:
* lab1a: color thresholding in RGB color space
* lab1b: color thresholding in HSV color space
* lab2: camera calibration
* lab3: histogram equalization and image filtering
* lab4: hough transform and edge detection
* lab5: panoramic image creation by SIFT features matching
* lab6: object recognition and tracking
* lab7: not present
* project: tree localization by semantic superpixel classification

Both laboratories and project contains an assignment and (almost every labs) a report that can be found in the report subdirectory.
For any information, fell free to contact me.
